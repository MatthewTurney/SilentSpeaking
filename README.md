# Silent Speaking

# Introduction 
This is a project aimed at creating an effective lip reading platform by converting lip movements directly to phonemes, then from phonemes to readable text. This allows for greater generalization and more accurate results.

# Getting Started
To test, first install LipNet using:
pip install -e . inside the LipNet directory.

Then run:
python recordVid.py
to run with the UI we created.



This was created as a project for the Microsoft Hackathon 2018.
